# Independent-Study-IMT-600-Spring

_______________________________
Machine Learning and Data Analysis scripts for IMT 600 course. The repository includes all the material for Machine Learning, Classifiers, Exploratory Data Analysis as well as all the certificate courses I have done in Spring 2018.

### Instructor: Prof. Bob Larson (Information School, University of Washington)

The repository contains all the scripts and results of the various algorithms on different kinds of datasets.

#### Some of the work done as a part of this study, is mentioned below:

- [__Movie Recommendor System__](https://github.com/thakremanas/Independent-Study-IMT-600-Spring/blob/master/IMT%20600-Movie%20Recommender%20System_Manas/Recommender%20Systems%20with%20Python.ipynb)
- [__Visualiziation using Plot.ly to make Choropleth Data Maps__](https://github.com/thakremanas/Independent-Study-IMT-600-Spring/tree/master/IMT%20600-Visualizing%20Data%20on%20Maps_Manas)
- [__Decision Trees and Random Forest comparison at a top level__](https://github.com/thakremanas/Independent-Study-IMT-600-Spring/blob/master/IMT%20600-Decision%20Trees%20and%20Random%20Forest%20Project_Manas.ipynb)
- [__Exploration of Principal Component Analysis on Breast Cancer Dataset__](https://github.com/thakremanas/Independent-Study-IMT-600-Spring/blob/master/IMT%20600-%20Exploring%20Principal%20Component%20Analysis_Manas.ipynb)
- [__Text Based modelling on SMS dataset to detect spam__](https://github.com/thakremanas/Independent-Study-IMT-600-Spring/blob/master/IMT%20600-Text%20Based%20Modelling-NLP%20_%20Manas%20.ipynb)

#### Some other accomplishment: 

- I formalized my [__github__](https://github.com/thakremanas) repository and included my important projects
- I used the learning from by Big Data course to setup a [__portfolio__](http://bit.do/manas-thakre) webpage on AWS
